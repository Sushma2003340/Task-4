# ðŸ§  Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

This project implements a *Logistic Regression* model to classify tumors as *Malignant* or *Benign* using the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset*.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

- *Task:* Classification with Logistic Regression  
- *Objective:* Build a binary classifier  
- *Dataset Used:* [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  
- *Tools Used:* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## âœ… What I Did

1. Loaded and explored the Breast Cancer dataset.
2. Preprocessed the data:
   - Encoded labels (Malignant=1, Benign=0)
   - Standardized features using StandardScaler
3. Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20).
4. Trained a *Logistic Regression* model using Scikit-learn.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision & Recall
   - Classification Report
   - ROC Curve & AUC Score
6. Tuned the decision threshold and analyzed its effect.
7. Plotted the *Sigmoid Function* to explain how logistic regression works.
